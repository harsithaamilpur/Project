#Crowdsourcing Mobility: Enhancing User Accessibility and Reducing Energy Consumption

Cities today face increasing challenges with traffic congestion, high energy usage, and the need for accessible transport. Existing navigation systems fail to respond effectively to real-time user behavior. This project addresses these issues by using crowdsourced mobility data and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to optimize travel routes dynamically. It promotes sustainable urban transport by learning from actual travel patterns, thereby reducing congestion, enhancing accessibility, and supporting the vision of smarter, greener cities. The solution is a smart urban mobility system that uses crowdsourced data and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to optimize routes in real time. It learns from user feedback, congestion levels, and accessibility needs to recommend energy-efficient and inclusive routes. The system supports multimodal transport and adapts continuously to changing conditions. This solution stands out by combining real-time crowdsourced data with a DQN algorithm for continuous, adaptive route optimization. It not only considers traffic flow but also factors like energy use and accessibilityâ€”often neglected in conventional systems. Its multimodal support and ability to learn from evolving user behavior give it a dynamic edge. Unlike competitors that rely on static maps or limited traffic data, our system uses real-time crowdsourced inputs and a DQN model to learn and adapt continuously. Most similar products lack a focus on energy efficiency or accessibility. In contrast, our solution integrates these aspects as core features, offering smarter and more inclusive route recommendations. Its dynamic learning, responsiveness to environmental changes, and multimodal flexibility make it a superior, future-ready alternative for addressing urban transport challenges.
